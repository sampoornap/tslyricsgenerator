
i have this thing where i get older but just never wiser
midnights become my afternoons
when my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
ive ghosted stand there in the room

i should not be left to my own devices
they come with prices and vices
i end up in crisis
tale as old as time
i wake up screaming from dreaming
one day ill watch as youre leaving
cause you got tired of my scheming
for the last time
its me hi
im the problem its me
at teatime everybody agrees
ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
it must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

sometimes i feel like everybody is a sexy baby
and im a monster on the hill
too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city
pierced through the heart but never killed

did you hear my covert narcissism i disguise as altruism
like some kind of congressman
a tale as old as time
i wake up screaming from dreaming
one day ill watch as youre leaving
and life will lose all its meaning
for the last time

its me hi
im the problem its me im the problem its me
at teatime everybody agrees
ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
it must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
chasing that fame he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight

my town was a wasteland
full of cages full of fences
pageant queens and big pretenders
but for some it was paradise
my boy was a montage
a slowmotion love potion
jumping off things in the ocean
i broke his heart cause he was nice
he was sunshine i was midnight rain
he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
chasing that fame he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight

it came like a postcard
picture perfect shiny family
holiday peppermint candy
but for him its every day
so i peered through a window
a deep portal time travel
all the love we unravel
and the life i gave away
cause he was sunshine i was midnight rain

he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
